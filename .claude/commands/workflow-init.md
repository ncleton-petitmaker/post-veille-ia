# Workflow Initialization

This command helps you start a new BMAD Method workflow by analyzing your project needs and recommending the appropriate track.

## Available Tracks

### 1. Quick Flow (< 5 minutes to start)
- **Best for**: Bug fixes, small features, quick improvements
- **Planning**: Tech spec only
- **Agents**: Solo Developer

### 2. BMad Method (< 15 minutes to start)
- **Best for**: New products, platforms, significant features
- **Planning**: PRD + Architecture + UX
- **Agents**: PM, Architect, UX Designer, Developer

### 3. Enterprise (< 30 minutes to start)
- **Best for**: Compliance-heavy projects, large scale systems
- **Planning**: Full governance suite
- **Agents**: Full team with additional oversight

## Getting Started

Tell me about your project:

1. **What are you building?** (Brief description)
2. **Is this a new project (greenfield) or existing codebase (brownfield)?**
3. **What's your timeline/urgency?**
4. **Any specific constraints?** (Technology, compliance, team size)

Based on your answers, I'll recommend the best workflow track and guide you through the process.

## Next Steps After Initialization

1. `/pm` - Start with Product Manager for requirements
2. `/architect` - Design the technical architecture
3. `/dev` - Begin implementation

Let's get started! What would you like to build?
